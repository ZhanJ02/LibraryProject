I created a base Book class with basic properties; I then created the EBook class that inherits from the Book class. 
The Library class is a collection of Books and EBooks; furthermore, the Main class implements all of these classes.
This is my beginning usage of C-Sharp as I was getting used to the syntax; I also had to code based on the .NET 8 framework.
I also included namespaces to organize and structure the code and classes.
